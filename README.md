I'm releasing everyone's SSN and the hacks used to acquire them so please freeze your credit with all 3 major credit bureaus.


# How to freeze your credit with all 3 bureaus
Contact each of the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — individually to freeze your credit:

Equifax: Call the automated line at 800-349-9960 or customer care at 888-298-0045, or go online.

Experian: Go online to initiate, or for information call 888‑397‑3742.

TransUnion: Call 800-916-8800 or 888-909-8872, or go online.

The quickest way to freeze your credit is online through your profile with each major credit bureau. But placing a freeze over the phone is also fast. Bureaus must place the freeze within one business day if you request it online or by phone, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. You can also submit requests by mail; they have three business days to freeze your credit after receiving the mailed request.
