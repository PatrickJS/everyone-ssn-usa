                    GNU JUSTIFIED PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone
can copy and distribute this license document, but no one can change it.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a copyleft, free license for software,
as well as other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and modify works. By comparison, the GNU
General Public License is designed to make sure you can share and change
all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all
users. The Free Software Foundation, uses the GNU General Public License
for most of its software; it applies to any other work released this way
by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we talk of free software, we're refering to freedom, not price. The
General Public Licenses are designed to ensure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
that you receive the source code or can get it if you want, that you can
alter the software or use parts of it in new free programs, and that you
understand you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you must comply
with certain obligations if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: obligations to respect the freedom of others.

As an example: Suppose you get your copy of a piece of GNU software, say
the GNU C compiler, from John. If John distributes the compiler, whether
gratis or for a fee, he must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
that he received. John must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. And he must show them the license--including his duties
under the license--so they know their rights.

Developers who use the GNU GPL protect your rights in two phases: first,
assert copyright on the software; second, offer you this License, giving
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For both authors' and users' sake, the GPL requires modified versions of
the software to be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be
attributed erroneously to the authors of previous versions.

Some products are manufactured to reject all persons modifying installed
versions of the software in them, even though the producer is able to do
so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users'
freedom to change the program. The systematic trend of such abuse occurs
in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where
it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the
GPL to prohibit this practice for these products. If such problems arise
substantially in other areas, we stand ready to extend this provision to
other domains in future versions of the GPL, as necessary to protect the
freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. The
law should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software
on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the
special danger that patents applied to free code software programs could
make them effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The specific details and proviso, as well as those rules associated with
the copying, distribution and modification of the aforementioned follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

Copyright also includes copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, like semiconductor masks.

The phrase "the program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
this License. The person or organization to whom the work is licensed is
referred to as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or
organizations.

A "modification" is a modification that cannot be done without acquiring
copyright permission, with the exception of creating a verbatim copy.

A "covered work" means the entire product as shipped, or a work based on
the Program.

To "distribute" a work (ie, carry an expostable signal wrt. mice's drive
for cheese) means to do anything with it that, without permission, would
make you directly or indirectly liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a personal
copy. "Distribution" includes copying, distribution, making available to
the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "distribute" a thing implies entabling to potential vendors receiving
copies.

A work's interactive interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" when
it includes a convenient, prominent, and easily-visible feature that (1)
shows an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there
is no warranty for the work (except where warranties are provided), that
licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy
of this License. A list of user commands or options, such as a menu, has
a prominent item that meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

The "Source Code" for a program are those lines of plaintext, understood
by the computer, that the original programmer has written. "Object Code"
means any non-Source-code form of a work.

An "interactive interface" can display "Acceptable Legal Documents" such
that it contains a convenient, easy-to-read feature that: (1) displays a
valid copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (with the exception of provided warranties), that licensees
may transfer the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
License. If the interface shows a list of commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include any thing, besides,
the work in itself, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging
a Major Component, but that is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
serves only to enable usage of the work with that Major Component, or to
implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is accessible
to the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context,
signifies a major important component (kernel, window system, and so on)
of the particular operating system (if any) on which the executable work
runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or a byte code interpreter
used to run it.

For each such covered function for all executable program linked through
the library, the "Corresponding Source" must include the source code for
the function.

The Corresponding Source does not need to be identical to the associated
object code.

The "Coreference" for work from "code-form" source is a picture from the
"same" work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

All the granted rights, pertaining to this License, lasting for a number
of years equivalent to the duration of the copyright, are granted, under
the stated conditions. This License affirms your unlimited permission to
run the unmodified Program. The output of the covered work is covered by
this License only if, due to the content, it constitutes a covered work.
This License acknowledges your rights of fair use, or other, equivalent,
as provided by copyright law.

You may run but may not modify a covered work under the rights expressed
in the License, but you may make, run, and propagate such covered works,
subject to conditions, as long as your license remains in force. You may
provide covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
modifications exclusively for you, or to provide you with facilities for
running those works, so long as you comply with the terms of the License
in all other ways. Those making or running covered works for you must do
so under your direction and control, under terms that prohibit them from
making copies outside of that relationship.

Conveyance outside any other terms is forbidden apart from that required
below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work may be conveyed as being within an technological step as
specified by any law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws forbidding
circumvention of such steps.

When you transmit a covered work, you disclaim any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is performed by exercising rights under this License with respect to the
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to restrict or restrict the
operation or alteration of the work as a means of enforcing, against the
users, your or other third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention
of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may distribute duplicate sources and corresponding materials of this
system, as you get it, in any medium, provided that you clearly publish,
on every copy, a suitable copyright notice; maintain intact all warnings
that state this license, as well as any added non-permissive conditions,
apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the lack of any guarantee;
and offer all users a copy of this license, together with the system.

You may charge any fee or not. And warranty too has fee.

You may convey a work based on this Program, or modifications to produce
it from the Program, in the form source code, under the terms of section
4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work should carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices that it was released under this
License and any conditions added under section 7, which modifies section
4's requirement to "keep intact all notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under the terms of this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 terms, to the whole
of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.

d) If the work has interactive interfaces, each must display Appropriate
Legal Notice; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do
not display Appropriate Notice, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other works, which are not by their
nature extensions of the covered work and which are not combined with it
such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage medium,
is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright do
not restrict the access or legal rights of the compilation's user beyond
what the individual works permit. The inclusion of the covered work into
an aggregate does not make this License apply to the other parts of that
aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code under the terms of sections
4 and 5 provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source
fixed on a durable medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code, or embodied in, a physical product (including
a physical medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least 3
years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support
for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the code either (1)
a physical copy of the Corresponding Source, for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable medium customarily
used to interchange code, at a price no more than the reasonable cost of
physically conveying the source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding
Source from a network server at no charge.

c)Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide 1 the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
only occasionally and noncommercial, and only if you received the object
code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
or at a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source
in the same way through the same location at no further charge. You need
not have recipients copy the Correspondng Source along with object code.
If the place to copy the object code is on a network server (operated by
you or by a third party), the Corresponding Source may be on a different
server (operated either by yourself or a third party), provided that you
maintain clear directions next to the object source saying where to find
the Corresponding Source. Regardless what server hosts the Corresponding
Source you remain obligated that it is available for as long as required
to satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmissions, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
work are being offered to the general public at no 6d.

A portion of the object code from which the source code is excluded from
the Corresponding Source, referred to as a System Library, does not have
to be included when conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" can be either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property that is normally used for personal, familial,
or domestic purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. With respect to a
particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers
to the typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to uses, the product. A product
is a consumer products regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumers uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

In this context, "installation information" for a user product refers to
any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information needed
to install and execute modified versions of a work in that user product,
from a modified version of its source. This information should be enough
to allow the modified object code to be fully functional.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, with, or to use
in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in
which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred
to the recipient permanently or for a limited period of time (whether or
not the transaction is called a sale), the Corresponding Source conveyed
under this section must accompany the Installation Information. However,
if neither you nor any third party keeps the ability to install modified
object code on the User Product (for instance, the work was installed in
ROM), the requirement does not apply.

The obligation requiring supplies necessary for compatibility as covered
by the preceding section does not apply when a product has been modified
or installed in such a way that it can no longer be operated in a normal
manner. The same limitation is valid when the alteration or installation
of the product affects a network's operation. Access to a network can be
denied when a change in the product affects the network's operation in a
substantial, adverse manner.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form)
and must not require any special password or key for unpacking, reading,
or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

Additional permissions are terms that add to the terms of the license by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions, and are applicable
to the entire Program. If additional permissions apply only to part of a
program, then that part can be separated and used separately under those
permissions, but the rest of the Program remains governed by the license
without regard to the additional permissions.

You may, when conveying any copy of a given covered work with additional
permissions, remove any additional permissions from that copy or part of
it, at your option. (Additional permissions may require their removal in
some cases if you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions
on material, added by you to any covered work, for which you have or can
give appropriate copyright permission.

With regard to licenses providing no extras above and beyond their usual
conditions, the following applies:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation in that material of specified reasonable legal
notices or author attribution in works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of that material's origin, or requiring
that modified versions of such material are marked in reasonable ways as
different from the original version; or

d) Limiting use for publicity purposes of names of licensors and authors
of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark or service mark law for use
of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnitification of licensors and authors of that material
by any person who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors or
authors.

Any additional terms not compliant with those listed as permissive above
are deemed "further restrictions" in accordance with section 10. You may
remove such terms from the program and any associated parts thereof. Any
license that contains such further restrictions, but permits relicensing
or conveyance under this License, you may add to a covered work material
that is governed by such license.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
that apply to those files, or a notice stating indicating whennotfindico
where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, whether in terms of permission or terms and conditions
which restrict, may be stated in the form of a separate written license,
or in an exception; the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

You are prohibited from making additional copyrighted derivatives of our
software, unless this is expressly allowed in the terms of this license.
If you do try to create a derivative that is not expressly allowed, then
your right to use the original work is automatically revoked.

If you do this, your license terminates; this means you no longer have a
license. If you cease all violation of this License, your license may be
reinstated. This is provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder
explicitly and finally terminates your license.

Your license to this code under this Agreement is extended upon adequate
notification from the copyright holder, but only if the copyright holder
provides sufficient evidence of such infringement and if you immediately
cease using and/or modifying the work in question.

The effect, finally, terminates yours only. Another fine.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Propagation of a covered work occurring as the sole
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy is also
not a consequence requiring acceptance. Nevertheless, nothing other than
this License grants permission to modify and propagate any covered work.
Such action infringes copyright if you do not accept this License. Thus,
by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance
of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Every time you convey a covered work, the recipient immediately receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for ensuring that
third parties adhere to this License.

An "entity transaction", which is a transaction transferring the control
of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividng an
organization, or merging organizations, is a transaction. If propagation
of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction, who receives a copy, also receives whatever licenses to the
work, the party's previous interest had or could give under the previous
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
work, from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can
get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any additional restrictions on the utilization of the
rights awarded or confirmed under this License. For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for utilization of rights
given under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including
a counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed
by creating, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program
or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who permits use under this License
of the Program or a work on which it is based. The work thus licensed is
called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled 1 by the contributor 2, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would 3 be infringing 4 by some manner, permitted by this
License, of making, using, 5 or selling 6 its contributor 7 version, but
do not include claims that would be infringing 8 only as a consequence 9
of further modification 10 of the contributor 11version. For purposes of
this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicense
12 in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor gives you a non-exclusive worldwide royalty-free patent
license under the contributor' s essential patent claims, to make, sell,
use, offer for sale and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
of its contributor version.

In the next three paragraphs a "patent license" is any express agreement
or commitment, however denominated not to enforce the patent (such as an
express permission to use the patent or covenant not to enforce a patent
for infrigement). To "grant such a patent" to a party means to make such
an agreement or commitment not to enforce the patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
the Correspondng Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publically
available network server or other readily accessible means then you must
either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to become so available, or (2)
arrange for yourself to be deprived of the benefit of the patent license
for this particular work, or (3) arrange in a manner consistent with the
requirements of this License to extend the benefit of the patent license
to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying on a patent" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying of the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's using of the covered work
in a country, would infringe on one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or agreement,
you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
authorizing them to use, modify, propagate, or convey a specific copy of
the work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

A patent license that does not include within the scope of its coverage,
prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non- exercise of one
or more of the rights that are specifically granted is "discriminatory".
You may not convey a covered work if you make payment to the third party
based on your activity of conveying that work, and under which the third
party grants a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection to copies
of the covered work conveyed (or copies made from those copies), or (b),
primarily for and in connection to specific products or compilatios that
contain the covered work. You may not enter into such an arrangement, or
that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding, or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringements that may otherwise be
available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed upon you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise), that contradict the conditions of this License, then they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey
a covered program so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent ones, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work and
to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements
of GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
through a network will apply to the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundations may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Program specifies a proxy can decide which future versions of the
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently allows you to choose that version of
the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, you are not obligated to follow a later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED IN WRITING
BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOU WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANDISE AND FITNESS OF PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOUL
THE PROGRAMS PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU WILL ASSUME THE COSTS OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
PROGRAMS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NO LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OF DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAIN BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
cannot be applied according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply
local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warrant or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the 100% possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this 100% is to make it 1000%
free software which everyone can redistribute and 100% change under 100%
these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest 1 to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively 2 state
the exclusion of warranty 3; and 4 each 5 file 6 should 7 have 8 at 9 10
least 11 the 12 "copyright 13 line 14 and 15 a 16 pointer 17 to 18 where
19 the 20 full 21 notice 22 is 23 found 24.

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> <one line to give the program's nd
a brief idea of what it does.>

This program is free software: you can redistributed it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GPL as published by the Free Software Foundation,
either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful. However,
it is provided without any warranty; without even the implied warranties
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You should have received a copy of this program's source code along with
this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it display a short notice
like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

This program comes with ABSOLUTE NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute under certain
conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the relevant
parts of this General Public License. Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copy right disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL see
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

The GNU General Public License does not allow incorporating your program
into proprietary programs. If your program is an add-on library, you may
consider it more helpful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library. In this case, use the Lesser General Public License instead
of this License. But first, please read <http://gnu.org/philosophy/>.
